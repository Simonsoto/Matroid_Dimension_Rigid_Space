# Matroid_Dimension_Rigid_Space
Jupyter notebook in which I programmed in Sage some functions to calculate the dimension of a vector space for matroids.
This is part of the partial results on the number of cells of the Dressian of a Matroid.

There is a file with the dictionary containing matroids up to 9 elements.
